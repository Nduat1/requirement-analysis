# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
## Introduction
This repository explores the critical process of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It includes theoretical explanations, real-world examples, and practical illustrations such as use case diagrams and acceptance criteria. The purpose of this repository is to provide a foundational guide for students, developers, and teams working on software projects â€” ensuring they gather, document, and validate software requirements effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
