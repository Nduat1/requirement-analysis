## Introduction
This repository explores the critical process of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It includes theoretical explanations, real-world examples, and practical illustrations such as use case diagrams and acceptance criteria. The purpose of this repository is to provide a foundational guide for students, developers, and teams working on software projects â€” ensuring they gather, document, and validate software requirements effectively.
